This project has been implemented via two methods:

1. Method 1: Without using packages, satisfying the requirements of the assignment

EXECUTING METHOD - 1: python main.py

2. Method 2: Using external packages. The reason for this is that Method 1 wasn't 	producing prefect results, despite tweaking the parameters.
(P.S: Independent Jupiter notebooks)
